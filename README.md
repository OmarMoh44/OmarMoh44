# 👋 Hi there

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Computer Engineering student at Cairo University, passionate about building secure and efficient web applications, as well as exploring the realms of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Through intensive training programs at Cairo University's Computer Engineering Department, I have honed my skills in modern web technologies, collaborative development practices, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning frameworks.

My journey in software development began with a focus on backend technologies, particularly Node.js and SQL databases, and has expanded to include expertise in data preprocessing, ML/DL model development, and full-stack development. I completed an intensive ML/DL training at Cairo University's Computer Engineering Department, where I enhanced my skills in machine learning algorithms, deep learning frameworks, and data preprocessing techniques.

During my studies, I've completed coursework in Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms Analysis, Database Management, Web Development, Computer Architecture, Software Engineering, Operating Systems, Neural Networks, and Image Processing. My training in ML/DL has equipped me with hands-on experience in implementing various machine learning models and working with deep learning frameworks.m Omar Mohammed!
